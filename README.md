# Cojourney

Cojourney is a new kind of social networking and personal connection app.

More to come, watch this space!

`yarn` is suggested in place of `npm` since it has better workspaces support.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
yarn build # build the packages at least once
```

## Usage

To start everything
```bash
yarn run dev
# App: http://localhost:3000
# Site: http://localhost:3001
# Docs: http://localhost:3002
# API: http://localhost:7998
```

Once you've started everything, you can talk to CJ, the default agent, by running the terminal: 
```bash
yarn run cj
```
