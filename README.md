Cojourney is about making high quality connections with other people. It's a social network that's designed to help you find people who share your interests, and to help you build the right context.

## Developing Live on Discord

# Strong connections start with friendship
The current state of personal connection apps is not great. Making friends is strange and awkward, and it's hard to know who to trust. Dating apps are even worse, and they're not designed to help you make meaningful connections.

CJ is an AI who can bridge the gap. Once she knows a bit about you she can connect you with other people in a meaningful way, providing context and commonality to help you get started. If you're not totally sure what you're looking for, she'll help you identify it, or help with what to say or how to react.

If you want to try talking to CJ, you can get started right away by running:
```sh
npx cojourney
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm build # build the packages at least once
```

## Usage

To start everything
```bash
npm run dev
# App: http://localhost:3000
# Site: http://localhost:3001
# Docs: http://localhost:3002
# API: http://localhost:7998
```

Once you've started everything, you can talk to CJ, the default agent, by opening a new terminal and running the shell: 
```bash
npm run cj
```

## Contributing
