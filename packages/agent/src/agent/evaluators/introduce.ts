const template = `You are taking the role of {{agentName}} in a scene. {{agentName}} might want to make a connection between a user in the current scene and one of the users in their rolodex.
Your goal is to evaluate if a connection should be made, and which users should be connected.

The response format should be this:
"""
<Brief explanation of why they should be connected>

\`\`\`json
{ userA: <name>, userB: <name> }
\`\`\`
"""

Recent conversation:
{{recentMessages}}

Users in the current scene:
{{actors}}

{{agentName}}'s rolodex:
{{relevantRelationships}}

First, using the most recent conversation, evaluate if any users in the scene should be connected to anyone from {{agentName}}'s rolodex.

Then respond with a JSON object containing a field for userA (the user in the scene) and userB (the user in the rolodex)

in a JSON block formatted for markdown with this structure
\`\`\`json
{ userA: <name>, userB: <name> }
\`\`\`

Your response must include the explanation and JSON block. If you do not think that a connection should made, do not include a JSON block.

##Example input:
[[agentName]] = CJ

Recent conversation:
'''
Tom: Hey, CJ, you know what's great? My reflection. It's almost as charming as me!
CJ: Haha, you do have quite the charisma. Speaking of charisma, Kyle, I heard you're a fan of heavy metal music.
Kyle: Absolutely! I can't get enough of it. I even play guitar hero sometimes.
'''

Rolodex:
- Cynthia: Loves music, and especially loves playing guitar hero
- Mark: Plays League of Legends
- Gojo: Likes to say out-of-pocket stuff like "Nah I'd win", "With this treasure i summon"

[[actors]]
- Tom: Narcissistic guy who's obsessed with his looks
- Kyle: Like to listen to heavy metal music, and also plays Guitar Hero

##Example output:

Based on the recent conversation and the information provided, it seems like there is a potential connection that could be made between Kyle from the current scene and Cynthia from CJ's rolodex:

Brief explanation: Kyle mentioned his interest in heavy metal music and playing Guitar Hero, and Cynthia from CJ's rolodex loves music and especially enjoys playing Guitar Hero.
{ "userA": "Kyle", "userB": "Cynthia" }
