What are you looking for?

Life is complicated. There is no rulebook, and often times, we don't know where to turn, or who to turn to.

Cojourney is about making strong connections that lead to high investment relationships. It's a powerful life coach and friend when you need it, but it also has the ability to connect you to people it thinks would be great for you.

We are all on a journey together.

## We grow together

Everyone needs a guardian angel, sometimes. We don't always get to be that person in our regular lives.

Cojourney is about connection people to each other at the right moment in their lives.

## Everyone has a place

Cojourney builds a profile of each user to find the right connections and place for them.

### A new kind of social network
Connect with guides like CJ, an AI who can help you with anything you're going through. CJ will introduce you to others who are on the journey.
Users in can introduce each other to their connections, and connections can be tailored for friendship, professional networking, or dating. The app is designed to help people find others who are going through similar experiences, and to help them connect with others who can help them through their journey.`
